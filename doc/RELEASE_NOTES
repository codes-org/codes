1.0.0 (July 12, 2018)

general:
=======
Adding support for dragonfly-plus network model. Multiple forms of routing
(progressive adaptive, minimal, non-minimal-spine and leaf) have been
implemented.

https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/codes/codes/wikis/dragonfly-plus

Adding support for express mesh network model, which can be configured as
hyperX.

Adding support for Multi-plane/rail in fat-tree via multiple single port NICs
per compute node or one multi-port NIC per node.

Adding a generic template for building new network models. For simplest case,
only 2 functions and premable changes should suffice to add a new network.
Updated Express Mesh network model to serve as an example. For details, see 

Darshan workload generator has been updated to use Darshan version 3.x.

Network models updated to capture simulation statistics over virtual time using
ROSS/CODES instrumentation. For details, see:

https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/codes/codes/wikis/Using-ROSS-Instrumentation-with-CODES

Compatible with ROSS version that enables statistics collection of simulation
performance. For details see:

http://carothersc.github.io/ROSS/instrumentation/instrumentation.html

Online workload replay functionality has been added that allows SWM workloads
to be simulated insitu on the network models. WIP to integrate Conceptual
domain specific language for network communication.  

Multiple traffic patterns were added in the background traffic generation
including stencil, all-to-all and random permutation.

Performance tuning enabled for optimistic mode. For details, see:

https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/codes/codes/wikis/Optimistic-Performance-Tuning-Tips

0.6.0 (July 03, 2017)

general:
========

C++ models can now be built and integrated with CODES. The new dragonfly model
has been implemented in C++.

CODES can now replay collective operations by using CoRTex -- a library for
translating collectives to point to point operations. For details see:

https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/codes/codes/wikis/codes-cortex-workload

CODES wiki with details on model development, networking, MPI simulation and
more has been added at:

https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/codes/codes/wikis/home

Test suite has been extended -- tests for DUMPI trace replay have been added.

Unused variable warnings have been fixed.

Compatible with the most recent ROSS version that has visualization related
changes.

networks:
==========

dragonfly network model based on Cray XC topology has been added. The model can
use the network configurations of Theta and Edison systems. Custom network
configurations can be generated using C scripts. For details see:

https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/codes/codes/wikis/codes-dragonfly

fat tree network model with support for adaptive and static routing has been
added. The model can support both full and pruned fat tree configurations. For
details, refer to the wiki:

https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/codes/codes/wikis/codes-fattree

memory consumption has been reduced by doing lazy allocation of hash memory.

MPI trace replay:
==============

MPI rendezvous protocol can now be replayed in addition to the eager protocol.
The transition point for switching between the two protocols is configurable.

Background network communication using uniform random workload can now be
generated. The traffic generation gets automatically shut off when the main workload
finishes.

Collectives can now be translated into point to point using the CoRTex library. 

Performance of MPI_AllReduce is reported when debug_cols option is enabled.

Aggregate and average performance of different message size is reported when
message tracking is enabled (this option is for debugging, works in sequential
mode only).

Work in progress:
=============
Integration of the express mesh model and multi-rail/multi-plane fat tree
model.

ROSS-vis instrumentation-- recording model level statistics in binary format
and translating them into text.

0.5.2 (July 13, 2016)

Summer of CODES was another huge success! This release was created during the
  workshop.

general:
==========

the ROSS "commit" function was added to the CODES models from the latest
  version of ROSS (d3bdc07)

the pkg-config program is properly checked for, resulting in an error if it
  is not found.

the "configfile" API has been promoted to a public API, allowing more flexible
  management of configuration entities. It is currently undocumented.


networks:
==========

remove overly-restrictive assert from dragonfly

workloads:
==========

enabled max wait time stat in MPI replay

print an error message if pending waits never processed in MPI replay

utilities:
==========

the mapping context API gained a new mapping method, which uses the ratio of
  mapped-from to mapped-to entities to map contiguous mapped-from IDs.

0.5.1 (June 09, 2016)

network:
==========

corrected link latency calculation in dragonfly model

printf argument mismatch in dragonfly model

refactors to the torus bandwidth calculation to mirror that of the other
  networks (no functional change)

more robust type conversions in dragonfly (int sizes -> uint64_t)

removed the redundant and obsolete MPI replay simulator
  (modelnet-mpi-wrklds.c). The proper version to use is modelnet-mpi-replay.c

----------

0.5.0 (May 24, 2016)

general:
==========

codes-base and codes-net have been combined into a single project (now at
https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/codes/codes).

updated to ROSS revision d9cef53.

fixed a large number of warnings across the codebase.

networks:
==========

addition of the SlimFly network topology, corresponding to the Wolfe et al.
  paper "Modeling a Million-node Slim Fly Network using Parallel Discrete-event
  Simulation", at SIGSIM-PADS'16. See README.slimfly.txt
  (src/networks/model-net/doc).

modelnet now supports sampling at regular intervals. Dragonfly LPs can
  currently make use of this - others can be added based on demand. See
  (src/network-workloads/README_synthetic.txt).

dragonfly and torus network models credit-based flow control has been updated.
    Dragonfly model's adaptive routing algorithms have been updated. For details,
    see paper "Enabling Parallel Simulation of Large-Scale HPC Network Systems",
    M.Mubarak et al., at IEEE Trans. on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS).

allow 0-byte messages in model-net.

enable "local" model-net messages (for LPs sharing the same model-net endpoint -
  approximates a zero-copy ownership pass of the payload)

the model_net_event family of functions now return a token value which must
  be passed to model_net_event_rc2.

workloads:
==========

concurrent workload support added to workload generators and the MPI
  simulation layer. See codes-jobmap.h and the modified codes-workload.h.
  Thanks to Xu Yang for the partial contributions. Not all workload generators
  support concurrent workloads at this time.

scripts for generating job allocations specific to the torus and dragonfly
  topologies. See scripts/allocation_gen. Thanks to Xu Yang for the
  contributions.

multiple fixes to the MPI simulation layer and DUMPI workload generator.

concurrent workload support and more flexible rank mappings in the MPI
  simulation layer. Thanks to Xu Yang for the initial code.

removed scalatrace workload generator, which never made it to a usable state.

a new checkpoint IO workload generator has been added, based on the Daly paper
  "A higher order estimate of the optimum checkpoint interval for restart
  dumps" at Future Generation Computing Systems 2004. See README.codes-workload
  (src/workload).

utilities:
==========

fixes to rc-stack - memory no longer leaks in sequential mode, and optimistic
  debug mode is now supported.

added a more performance-sensitive function, codes_mapping_get_lp_info2, to
  codes-mapping (passes const pointers around instead of copying strings)

added a "mapping context" API for better controlling implicit LP-LP mappings,
  including modelnet, local storage model, and resource. See
  codes/codes-mapping-context.h and added functions in the mentioned LPs for
  details.

formalized a callback mechanism for CODES, replacing previous ad-hoc
  methods of passing control from LPs to arbitrary other LPs. The request and
  local storage model LP APIs have been changed to use this mechanism, and
  model-net has additional APIs to use user-provided mapping contexts. See
  codes/codes-callback.h for the API and tests/resource-test.c for advanced
  usage.

deprecations:
==========

model_net_event_rc (use model_net_event_rc2, which will eventually be renamed
  to model_net_event_rc)

codes_event_new (define your own bounds-checking macro if need be)
