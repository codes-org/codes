Notes on how to release a new version of CODES
2016-10
-----------------------

0. Determine what to release
- check CODES GitLab to see if there are any pending tickets that should be
  resolved for this release
  (https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/codes/issues)
- if there are WIP pieces of code (say, a network or workload model...), make
  sure to note them as such in the release notes

1. Document
- Ensure public headers are sufficiently documented
- Update release notes at doc/RELEASE_NOTES
  - A useful heuristic is to go through the git commit log, then cull down and
    categorize the updates. Example:
    'git log --topo-order --format="** %h %s <%an>%+b" 0.5.2..master > release-log.out'
    (replace the release tag as appropriate)
    See 'man git-log' for other options.
- Update doc/BUILD_STEPS (if necessary) and doc/GETTING_STARTED
  - GETTING_STARTED is more of a feature and usage overview now, so new
    features should be documented at a high level there.
  - Update the ROSS commit hash used to build codes in BUILD_STEPS
- Point to misc. documentation. We have scattered documents around, make sure
  people can find them.
- Update version number in configure.ac

2. Generate/test release tarball
- Run 'make dist' to generate a distribution tarball
- Extract the tarball in another directory, configure, run 'make check'
- Verify that non-source files to distribute (docs, test conf files, etc.) have
  been added to EXTRA_DIST in Makefile.am and the various Makefile.subdir's and
  are present in the tarball. To get a list of files to check, run:
  'git diff --name-only --diff-filter=A 0.5.2..master'
  (replace the release tag as appropriate)

3. Tag release
- Create an annotated tag containing just the version number as the name. E.g.,
  'git tag -a 0.5.3 -m "CODES 0.5.3 Release"'
  (replace the release tag as appropriate)
- Push the tag ('git push origin 0.5.3')
  (replace the release tag as appropriate)

4. Upload the release tarball
- For release versions 1.1.0 and onwards, we have started uploading the tarballs directly at the CODES website instead of mounting on the FTP server.
- For previous releases, we uploaded them on the ftp server. See notes below.
- Our release directory is at ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/CODES/releases . There's no
  web interface, so you have to get onto an MCS workstation and copy the
  release in that way (the ftp server is mounted at /homes/ftp).

5. Update website
- Project wordpress: http://www.mcs.anl.gov/projects/codes/ (you need
  permission to modify)
-- Add an entry to the Downloads page
-- Make a announcement blog entry. For an example, see
   http://www.mcs.anl.gov/projects/codes/2016/07/15/codes-0-5-2-released/

6. Announce to mailing lists
- codes-ross-users@lists.mcs.anl.gov
- codes-core@lists.mcs.anl.gov

7. Go on break
