This document serves the following purposes:
* CODES updates to accommodate Union online simulations
* Installation tutorial
* Known issues

= CODES updates

The code modifications are started with comment text "Xin:"

== Header file

Added parameters for collecting router traffic data, including:
* codes/model-net.h
* codes/net/dragonfly-custom.h
* codes/net/dragonfly-dally.h

== Makefile

Added checking for Union installation in the autoconf configure script configure.ac
Added src/workload/methods/codes-conc-online-comm-wrkld.C to code base if compile with Union in Makefile.am

== Union online workload

We add a pluggable workload module "src/workload/methods/codes-conc-online-comm-wrkld.C" into CODES workload generator to hold the actual implementation of Union communication events, such that the messages from Union skeletons can be emitted as simulation events in CODES.

== Router status collection for dragonfly custom and dragonfly dally

Added supportive functions for collecting traffic data on router port on the following network models:
* dragonfly custom at src/networks/model-net/dragonfly-custom.C
* dragonfly dally at src/networks/model-net/dragonfly-dally.C

== Updates in MPI replay

Added Union online workload type in MPI workload replay at src/network-workloads/model-net-mpi-replay.c

== Configurations

We added the following items in the CODES configuration file for collecting router traffic information during simulation.

* counting_bool - flag to enable/disable the collection of trouter traffic
* counting_start - the start time in microsecond for collecting traffic data
* counting_interval - the time window size in microsecond for collection traffic data
* counting_windows - the number of time windows for collecting traffic data
* num_apps - the number of applications in the simulation workload
* offset - supportive parameter for getting the application id of each packet 

An example configuration can be found at: https://github.com/SPEAR-IIT/Union/blob/master/test/df1d-72-adp.conf

= Installation tutorial

Please follow the Readme at: https://github.com/SPEAR-IIT/Union to install Union and run test simulation of Union online workloads.

= Completed Experiments 

We have completed the following experiments with Union online workload simulation:
* simulate Conceptual skeletons alone
* simulate Conceptual and SWM skeletons simultaneously
* simulate Conceptual and SWM skeletons simultaneously with different synthetic traffic patterns

The above experiments have been done on both dragonfly custom and dragonfly dally network models, with sequential mode and optimistic mode.

= Known Issues

Currently the rendezvous protocol in MPI replay cannot work with Union online workloads.
The reverse function router_buf_update_rc() does not take care of the cross window reverses for aggregated busytime on port.
