# This script is an example pattern generator for use with the congestion controller module
# in CODES. It generates patterns, one per line, that when matched, indicate that the network
# is in a state of congestion. These patterns are used by the supervisory controller, looking
# at the last N number of measurement periods (epochs) for whether the ports or NICs experienced
# congestion, if the pattern of the last N measurement periods matches any pattern provided by
# this file, then congestion has been detected in the network.
# This is a brute force attempt but since these files only need to be generated once, it's not
# so important that this be the most optimized that it could be.

#NOTE: 6-6-2021 DEPRECATED - This was necessary for v1 of the congestion control feature. This version was
#               not great and part of the reason was that it relied on patterns like these for detection
#               of congestion. This file will eventually be removed entirely from the repo but was left
#               as a monument to my wasted time. Congestion Control v1 was wiped and replaced by v2.
